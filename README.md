## Features

- Built-in http server to authenticate with Strava.
- Fetching of Strava activities.
- Visited POI (predefined point-of-interest) matching.
- Filtering by activity name, activity type, min/max distance, visited POI.
- Running streak computation.
- Heatmaps.

## Usage

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/flopp/activities.git
cd activities
python3 -m venv .env
.env/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
.env/bin/pip install .
```

### Fetch API Config from Strava (once!)

1. Create an "Application" on https://www.strava.com/settings/api; for "Authorization Callback Domain" use `localhost`, for all other properties you can basically use whatever you want ;)
2. Copy `config-example.json` to `config.json` and fill in the "Client ID" and the "Client Secret" from the "My API Application" section on https://www.strava.com/settings/api.

### Authenticate with Strava (once!)

```
.env/bin/activities \
    --auth
```

Now a web browser window should open with an "Authenticate with Strava" button. If not, manually open `localhost:5000` in a web browser of your choice. Click "Authenticate with Strava". Allow access for the app.
The authentication data is now saved in `data.db` for later use.

### Sync

```
.env/bin/activities \
    --sync \
    --browser
```

This fetches your Strava data, creates a static website, and opens a browser to view the website.
You can also manually point a web browser of your choice to `file:///INSTALLATION_PATH/web/index.html`...

### Visited POI Computation

If you want to know which points-of-interest (POI), e.g. peaks of mountains, you have visited on each activity, create a JSON file containing the names and lat/lon pairs of your POI, e.g.

```
{
    "Belchen": {"lat": 47.822496, "lon": 7.833198},
    "Feldberg": {"lat": 47.873986, "lon": 8.004683},
    "Hinterwaldkopf": {"lat": 47.918979, "lon": 8.016681},
    "Kandel": {"lat": 48.062517, "lon": 8.011391},
    "Kybfelsen": {"lat": 47.960851, "lon": 7.885071},
    "Rosskopf": {"lat": 48.010010, "lon": 7.901702},
    "Schauinsland": {"lat": 47.911940, "lon": 7.898506},
    "Sch√∂nberg": {"lat": 47.954722, "lon": 7.805504}
}
```

Then just add the option `--poi mypoi.json` to your `.env/bin/activities` command.
